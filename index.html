          <h1 class="title">A typical conversation of mine <br>this summer in Taiwan</h1>
          <ul class="verse active-verse" id="verse1">
            <li>Hello, my (English) name is Jordan</li>
            <li>Sorry, my Chinese isn't too good—</li>
            <li>It's good! you insist,</li>
            <li>But after a few minutes we move past formalities</li>
            <li>And suddenly, defining</li>
            <li>One word I don't know takes</li>
            <li>Three words I don't know</li>
            <li>And you try to help me, but language divides us</li>
            <li>And I give up.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="verse" id="verse2">
            <li>As a kid I learned Chinese from my mom</li>
            <li>And from Sunday school.</li>
            <li>As a kid I wasn't afraid</li>
            <li>To open my mouth and speak in my family's language</li>
            <li>But now, I think about</li>
            <li>How the young clerk at the store insists on speaking English to me</li>
            <li>And not his family's language,</li>
            <li>How my friend laughs when I speak slowly,</li>
            <li>How I use an app to translate with my own family,</li>
            <li>How I can't remember how to write my own name,</li>
            <li>And I hesitate.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="verse" id="verse3">
            <li>It's hard to learn a language</li>
            <li>In a world which treats language like an art,</li>
            <li>In schools which teach language like a formula,</li>
            <li>A middle school aged boy I taught</li>
            <li>So afraid of being wrong</li>
            <li>That he refused to open his lips.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="verse" id="verse4">
            <li>Hello, my name is Jordan</li>
            <li>I tell my grandmother's friend</li>
            <li>He tells me that my Chinese is very good and I thank him.</li>
            <li>He asks if he can practice his English with me, and</li>
            <li>With every sentence, he smiles.</li>
            <li>And then he tells me: </li>
            <li>As long as we understand each other,</li>
            <li>It doesn't matter how we speak.</li>
